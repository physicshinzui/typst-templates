              solvent models provide valuable information on the detailed
              behavior of protein-partner substrate binding at the atomic
              level. As the power of computational resources increase, MD
              simulations are being used more widely and easily. However, it is
              still difficult to investigate the thermodynamic properties of
              protein-partner substrate binding and protein folding with
              conventional MD simulations. Enhanced sampling methods have been
              developed to sample conformations that reflect equilibrium
              conditions in a more efficient manner than conventional MD
              simulations, thereby allowing the construction of accurate
              free-energy landscapes. In this review, we discuss these enhanced
              sampling methods using a series of case-by-case examples. In
              particular, we review enhanced sampling methods conforming to
              trivial trajectory parallelization, virtual-system coupled
              multicanonical MD, and adaptive lambda square dynamics. These
              methods have been recently developed based on the existing method
              of multicanonical MD simulation. Their applications are reviewed
              with an emphasis on describing their practical implementation. In
              our concluding remarks we explore extensions of the enhanced

              To gain insights into the molecular details of nucleation, some

              these simulations, in turn, are limited by their ability to run

              simulation methods. This work advances a computational framework
              for conducting simulations of LLPS with residue-level detail, and
              allows for the determination of phase diagrams and coexistence
              densities of proteins in the two phases. The model includes a
              short-range contact potential as well as a simplified treatment
              of electrostatic energy. Interaction parameters are optimized
              against experimentally determined radius of gyration data for
              multiple unfolded or intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs).
              These models are applied to two systems which undergo LLPS: the
              low complexity domain of the RNA-binding protein FUS and the
              DEAD-box helicase protein LAF-1. We develop a novel simulation
              method to determine thermodynamic phase diagrams as a function of
              the total protein concentration and temperature. We show that the
              model is capable of capturing qualitative changes in the phase
              diagram due to phosphomimetic mutations of FUS and to the
              presence or absence of the large folded domain in LAF-1. We also
              explore the effects of chain-length, or multivalency, on the
              phase diagram, and obtain results consistent with Flory-Huggins
              theory for polymers. Most importantly, the methodology presented
              here is flexible so that it can be easily extended to other pair
              potentials, be used with other enhanced sampling methods, and may
              incorporate additional features for biological systems of
              interest.",

              continuum Langevin chain model wherein each amino acid residue is
              represented by a single bead. Charge patterns are characterized
              by the ``blockiness'' measure $\kappa$ and the ``sequence charge
              decoration'' (SCD) parameter. Consistent with random phase
              approximation (RPA) theory and lattice simulations, LLPS
              propensity as characterized by critical temperature Tcr*
              increases with increasingly negative SCD for a set of sequences
              showing a positive correlation between $\kappa$ and -SCD.
              Relative to RPA, the simulated sequence-dependent variation in
              Tcr* is often-though not always-smaller, whereas the simulated

              propensity of a strictly alternating charge sequence was likely

              independently to one another, computational sampling for the
              important process is difficult. Here, to sample such a process
              effectively, we developed a new method, named the
              ``multi-dimensional Virtual-system coupled Monte Carlo
              (multi-dimensional-VcMC)'' method, where the system interacts
              with a virtual system expressed by two or more virtual
              coordinates. Each virtual coordinate controls sampling along a
              reaction coordinate. By setting multiple reaction coordinates to
              be related to the corresponding rare events, sampling of the
              important process can be enhanced. An advantage of
              multi-dimensional-VcMC is its simplicity: Namely, the
              conformation moves widely in the multi-dimensional reaction
              coordinate space without knowledge of canonical distribution
              functions of the system. To examine the effectiveness of the
              algorithm, we introduced a toy model where two molecules
              (receptor and its ligand) bind and unbind to each other. The
              receptor has a deep binding pocket, to which the ligand enters
              for binding. Furthermore, a gate is set at the entrance of the
              pocket, and the gate is usually closed. Thus, the molecular
              binding takes place via the two events: ligand approach to the
              pocket and gate opening. In two-dimensional (2D)-VcMC, the two
              molecules exhibited repeated binding and unbinding, and an
              equilibrated distribution was obtained as expected. A
              conventional canonical simulation, which was 200 times longer
              than 2D-VcMC, failed in sampling the binding/unbinding

              thermodynamically stable states (low-energy basins), which are
              connected by narrow conformational pathways (i.e., bottlenecks),
              the narrowness slows the inter-basin round trips in
              conformational sampling. This results in inaccuracy of free
              energies for the basins. This difficulty is not cleared out even
              when an enhanced conformational sampling is fairly performed
              along a reaction coordinate. In this study, to enhance the
              inter-basin round trips we introduced a virtual state that covers
              the narrow pathways. The probability distribution function for
              the virtual state was controlled based on detailed balance
              condition for the inter-state transitions (transitions between
              the real-state basins and the virtual state). To mimic the

              sampling efficiency 100 times higher than a conventional MC does.
              This result goes against ones intuition, because one considers

              the transition probability. The present method is readily

              performed along with adaptive umbrella sampling. Free-energy

              well. The VcMD provided quicker association/dissociation motions
              of peptides than the conventional molecular dynamics did. The
              VcMD method is applicable to various complicated systems because
              of its methodological simplicity. \copyright{} 2018 Wiley

              ligand egress routes without prior knowledge of the reaction

              Cytochrome P450cam from Pseudomonas putida has provided a
              paradigm for the structural understanding of cytochrome P450s.
              However, the mechanism by which camphor, the natural substrate of
              cytochrome P450cam, accesses the buried active site is a
              long-standing puzzle. While there is recent crystallographic and
              simulation evidence for opening of a substrate-access channel in
              cytochrome P450BM-3, for cytochrome P450cam, no such
              conformational changes have been observed either in different
              crystal structures or by standard molecular dynamics simulations.
              Here, a novel simulation method, random expulsion molecular
              dynamics, is presented, in which substrate-exit channels from the
              buried active site are found by imposing an artificial randomly
              oriented force on the substrate, in addition to the standard
              molecular dynamics force field. The random expulsion molecular
              dynamics method was tested in simulations of the substrate-bound
              structure of cytochrome P450BM-3, and then applied to complexes
              of cytochrome P450cam with different substrates and with product.
              Three pathways were identified, one of which corresponds to a
              channel proposed earlier on the basis of crystallographic and
              site-directed mutagenesis data. Exit via the water-filled
              channel, which was previously suggested to be a product exit
              channel, was not observed. The pathways obtained by the random
              expulsion molecular dynamics method match well with thermal
              motion pathways obtained by an analysis of crystallographic
              B-factors. In contrast to large backbone motions (up to 4 A)
              observed in cytochrome P450BM-3 for the exit of palmitoleic acid,
              passage of camphor through cytochrome P450cam only requires small
              backbone motions (less than 2.4 A) in conjunction with side-chain
              rotations. Concomitantly, in almost all the exit trajectories,
              salt-links that have been proposed to act as ionic tethers

              and are therefore increasingly being considered during lead
              optimization. For this purpose, computational methods to predict
              residence times, $\tau$, for drug-like compounds and to derive
              structure-kinetic relationships are desirable. A challenge for
              approaches based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is the
              fact that drug residence times are typically orders of magnitude
              longer than computationally feasible simulation times. Therefore,
              enhanced sampling methods are required. We recently reported one
              such approach: the $\tau$RAMD procedure for estimating relative
              residence times by performing a large number of random
              acceleration MD (RAMD) simulations in which ligand dissociation
              occurs in times of about a nanosecond due to the application of
              an additional randomly oriented force to the ligand. The length
              of the RAMD simulations is used to deduce $\tau$. The RAMD
              simulations also provide information on ligand egress pathways
              and dissociation mechanisms. Here, we describe a machine learning
              approach to systematically analyze protein-ligand binding
              contacts in the RAMD trajectories in order to derive regression
              models for estimating $\tau$ and to decipher the molecular
              features leading to longer $\tau$ values. We demonstrate that the
              regression models built on the protein-ligand interaction
              fingerprints of the dissociation trajectories result in robust
              estimates of $\tau$ for a set of 94 drug-like inhibitors of heat
              shock protein 90 (HSP90), even for the compounds for which the
              length of the RAMD trajectories does not provide a good
              estimation of $\tau$. Thus, we find that machine learning helps
              to overcome inaccuracies in the modeling of protein-ligand
              complexes due to incomplete sampling or force field deficiencies.
              Moreover, the approach facilitates the identification of features
              important for residence time. In particular, we observed that
              interactions of the ligand with the sidechain of F138, which is
              located on the border between the ATP binding pocket and a
              hydrophobic transient sub-pocket, play a key role in slowing
              compound dissociation. We expect that the combination of the
              $\tau$RAMD simulation procedure with machine learning analysis
              will be generally applicable as an aid to target-based lead
              optimization.",

               of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we
               explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics
               (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute
               dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies
               predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions
               could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious
               impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not
               always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The
               predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric
               constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined
               according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding
               interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large
               fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots
               are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated
               the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three
               Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model
               developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in
               ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors.
               Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in
               predicting binding free energies. Our results showed that
               MM/PBSA performed better in calculating absolute, but not
               necessarily relative, binding free energies than MM/GBSA.
               Considering its computational efficiency, MM/GBSA can serve as a

              also be used to accurately simulate the binding/unbinding
              pathway. Furthermore, it can also predict alternative binding
              sites, including allosteric ones, by employing an exhaustive
              sampling approach. Since McMD-based dynamic docking accurately
              samples binding/unbinding events, it can thus be used to
              determine the molecular mechanism of binding between two
              molecules. We developed the McMD-based dynamic docking
              methodology based on the powerful, but woefully underutilized
              McMD algorithm, combined with a toolset to perform the docking
              and to analyze the results. Here, we showcase three of our recent
              works, where we have applied McMD-based dynamic docking to
              advance the field of computational drug design. In the first
              case, we applied our method to perform an exhaustive search
              between Hsp90 and one of its inhibitors to successfully predict
              the native binding configuration in its binding site, as we
              refined our analysis methods. For our second case, we performed
              an exhaustive search of two medium-sized ligands and Bcl-xL,
              which has a cryptic binding site that differs greatly between the
              apo and holo structures. Finally, we performed a dynamic docking
              simulation between a membrane-embedded GPCR molecule and a high
              affinity ligand that binds deep within its receptor's pocket.

              Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been shown as powerful
              tools to study protein aggregation. However, conventional MD
              simulations can hardly sample the whole conformational space of
              complex protein systems within acceptable simulation time as it
              can be easily trapped in local minimum-energy states. Many

              replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method has gained
              great popularity. By combining MD simulation with the Monte Carlo
              algorithm, the REMD method is capable of overcoming high

              functions that are often not well correlated with the true energy

              very similar to the lowest-energy conformations and others of
              which are very different. In this paper, we propose a conditional
              deep generative graph neural network that learns an energy

              that are energetically favorable and more likely to be observed

               molecular dynamics simulation starting from one conformational
               state as initial structure and using the other for a directing
               constraint. The method is exemplified with the T ? R transition
               of insulin. The most striking difference between these
               conformational states is that in T the 8 N-terminal residues of
               the B chain are arranged as an extended strand whereas in R they
               are forming a helix. Both the transition from T to R and from R
               to T were simulated. The method proves capable of finding a
               continuous pathway for each direction which are moderately
               different. The refolding processes are illustrated by a series
               of transient structures and pairs of ?, ? angles selected from
               the time course of the simulations. In the T ? R direction the
               helix is formed in the ?last third of the transition, while in

               solution phase reaction models. (a) For gas phase bimolecular

               methods. Alternate formulas for $\kappa$ are derived which focus
               on saddle point surfaces, thus increasing computational
               efficiency. Advantages of the SSP formulas for $\kappa$ are
               discussed. (b) For gas phase unimolecular reactions, simple
               results for $\kappa$ are found in both the strong and weak
               coupling collision limits; the often ignored role of product

               in solution, we evaluate $\kappa$ for a generalized

              nitrogen with noble gases per se had no effects on the viability
              of cultured human osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Conversely, argon

              limited cell loss induced by the broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase
              inhibitor staurosporine, the DNA-damaging agent mitoxantrone and
              several mitochondrial toxins. Such cytoprotective effects were
              coupled to the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, as
              demonstrated by means of a mitochondrial transmembrane
              potential-sensitive dye and by assessing the release of
              cytochrome c into the cytosol. In line with this notion, argon
              and xenon inhibited the apoptotic activation of caspase-3, as
              determined by immunofluorescence microscopy coupled to automated
              image analysis. The antiapoptotic activity of argon and xenon may
              explain their clinically relevant cytoprotective effects.",

              learning--based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, that
              has outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental
              tests. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence
              recovery of 52.4\% compared with 32.9\% for Rosetta. The amino
              acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between
              single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range
              of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad
              utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray
              crystallography, cryo--electron microscopy, and functional
              studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made

              that folds to a desired structure, most approaches remain based
              on energy optimization. In two papers, a range of protein design
              problems were addressed through deep learning methods. Dauparas
              et al. built on recent deep learning protein design approaches to
              develop a method called ProteinMPNN. They validated designs

              cyclic homo-oligomers. Although the designs were generated to
              achieve stable expression, the sequences had to be regenerated

                   is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential

                   distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly

                   transforms the prior distribution back into the data

                   field (\textbackslashaka, score) of the perturbed data

                   generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores
                   with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to

              Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the
              extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which
              mediates host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting
              enzyme 2 (ACE2). Similar to many other viral fusion proteins, the
              SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host
              immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of the
              glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed
              states, augmenting the available structural and biological data.
              Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics
              simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the
              roles of glycans and on the protein structure and dynamics. We
              reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165
              and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike's
              receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for ACE2
              recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer
              interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these
              glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces
              binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift
              toward the ``down'' state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility
              analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of
              the glycan shield of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which may be

              machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional
              and structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its

               has shown its ability to automatically characterize molecular

              across the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2) (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use the
              receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral surface spike (S) protein
              to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
              receptor expressed on many human cell types. The RBD-ACE2
              interaction is a crucial step to mediate the host cell entry of
              SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction
              with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a higher affinity than its
              binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1,
              the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the
              biophysical mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is
              unclear. This study utilizes combined single-molecule force
              spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation
              approaches to quantify the specific interactions between
              SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the loading
              rates, the unbinding forces between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range
              from 70 to 105 pN and are 30-40\% higher than those of SARS-CoV-1
              RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results indicate
              that SARS-CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90
              of ACE2. This interaction is mostly absent in the SARS-CoV-1
              RBD-ACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra
              RBD-N-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and
              prolonged interaction lifetime. The observation is confirmed by
              our experimental force spectroscopy study. After removing
              N-linked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with
              SARS-CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar level of the SARS-CoV-1
              RBD-ACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism
              behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and

              hampered by the slow equilibration on rugged landscapes

              an apo form or that are induced by ligand binding. The
              investigation of cryptic sites is crucial for drug discovery,
              since these sites are ubiquitous in disease-related human
              proteins, and targeting them expands the number of drug targets
              greatly. However, although many computational studies have
              attempted to identify cryptic sites, the detection remains
              challenging. Here, we aimed to characterize and detect cryptic
              sites in terms of structural fluctuations in an apo form,
              investigating proteins each of which possesses a cryptic site.
              From their X-ray structures, we saw that aromatic residues tended
              to be found in cryptic sites. To examine structural fluctuations
              of the apo forms, we performed molecular dynamics (MD)
              simulations, producing probability distributions of the
              solvent-accessible surface area per aromatic residue. To detect
              aromatic residues in cryptic sites, we have proposed a
              ``cryptic-site index'' based on the distribution, demonstrating
              the performance via several measures, such as recall and
              specificity. Besides, we found that high-ranking aromatic

  abstract = "COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the
              novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It has become a global pandemic and
              its frequent mutations may pose new challenges for vaccine
              design. During viral infection, the Spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds
              the human host cell receptor ACE2, enabling the virus to enter
              the host cell. Both the Spike and ACE2 are densely glycosylated,
              and it is unclear how distinctive glycan types may modulate the
              interaction of RBD and ACE2. Detailed understanding of these
              determinants is key for the development of novel therapeutic
              strategies. To this end, we perform extensive all-atom
              simulations of the (i) RBD-ACE2 complex without glycans, (ii)
              RBD-ACE2 with oligomannose MAN9 glycans in ACE2, and (iii)
              RBD-ACE2 with complex FA2 glycans in ACE2. These simulations
              identify the key residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface that form
              contacts with higher probabilities, thus providing a quantitative
              evaluation that complements recent structural studies. Notably,
              we find that this RBD-ACE2 contact signature is not altered by
              the presence of different glycoforms, suggesting that RBD-ACE2
              interaction is robust. Applying our simulated results, we
              illustrate how the recently prevalent N501Y mutation may alter
              specific interactions with host ACE2 that facilitate the
              virus-host binding. Furthermore, our simulations reveal how the
              glycan on Asn90 of ACE2 can play a distinct role in the binding
              and unbinding of RBD. Finally, an energetics analysis shows that
              MAN9 glycans on ACE2 decrease RBD-ACE2 affinity, while FA2
              glycans lead to enhanced binding of the complex. Together, our
              results provide a more comprehensive picture of the detailed
              interplay between virus and human receptor, which is much needed
              for the discovery of effective treatments that aim at modulating

              field, the bias-variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with
              the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning
              practice. The bias-variance trade-off implies that a model should
              balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express
              underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting
              spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models
              such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e.,
              interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be
              considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on
              test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about
              the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their
              relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the
              classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified

              sites require a conformational change to become apparent; a
              cryptic site can therefore be defined as a site that forms a
              pocket in a holo structure, but not in the apo structure. Because
              many proteins appear to lack druggable pockets, understanding and
              accurately identifying cryptic sites could expand the set of drug
              targets. Previously, cryptic sites were identified experimentally
              by fragment-based ligand discovery and computationally by long
              molecular dynamics simulations and fragment docking. Here, we
              begin by constructing a set of structurally defined apo-holo
              pairs with cryptic sites. Next, we comprehensively characterize
              the cryptic sites in terms of their sequence, structure, and
              dynamics attributes. We find that cryptic sites tend to be as
              conserved in evolution as traditional binding pockets but are
              less hydrophobic and more flexible. Relying on this
              characterization, we use machine learning to predict cryptic
              sites with relatively high accuracy (for our benchmark, the true
              positive and false positive rates are 73\% and 29\%,
              respectively). We then predict cryptic sites in the entire
              structurally characterized human proteome (11,201 structures,
              covering 23\% of all residues in the proteome). CryptoSite
              increases the size of the potentially ``druggable'' human
              proteome from ~40\% to ~78\% of disease-associated proteins.
              Finally, to demonstrate the utility of our approach in practice,

  abstract  = "Binding affinity of a small ligand to a receptor is the
               important quantity in drug design, and it might be characterized
               by different quantities. The most popular one is the binding
               free energy, which can be estimated by several methods in
               conventional molecular dynamics simulation. So far in steered
               molecular dynamics (SMD), one can use either the rupture force
               or nonequilibrium pulling work as a measure for binding
               affinity. In this paper, we have shown that the nonequilibrium
               binding free energy $\Delta$ GneqJar, obtained by Jarzynski's
               equality at a finite pulling speed, has good correlation with
               experimental data on inhibition constants, implying that this
               quantity can be used as a good scoring function for binding
               affinity. A similar correlation has also been disclosed for
               binding and unbinding free energy barriers. Applying the SMD
               method to unbinding of 23 small compounds from the binding site
               of $\beta$-lactamase protein, a bacteria-produced enzyme, we
               have demonstrated that the rupture or unbinding time strongly
               correlates with experimental data with correlation level R
               $\approx$ 0.84. As follows from the Jarzynski's equality, the
               rupture time depends on the unbinding barrier exponentially. We
               show that $\Delta$ GneqJar, the rupture time, and binding and
               unbinding free energy barriers are good descriptors for binding
               affinity. Our observation may be useful for fast screening of
               potential leads as the SMD simulation is not time-consuming. On
               the basis of nonequilibrium simulation, we disclosed that, in

              spectropolarimetry (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry

              is monomeric, almost fully alpha-helical at -10 degrees C, and
              undergoes a reversible transition from the folded to the
              disordered state with increasing temperature. The temperature
              dependencies of the ellipticity at 222 nm and the excess heat
              capacity measured calorimetrically are well fit by a two-state
              model, which indicates a cooperative melting transition that is
              complete within the temperature ranges of these experiments (from
              -10 degrees C to 100 degrees C). This allows a complete analysis
              of the thermodynamics of helix formation. The helix unfolding is
              found to proceed with a small positive heat-capacity increment,
              consistent with the solvation of some non-polar groups upon helix
              unfolding. It follows that the hydrogen bonds are not the only
              factors responsible for the formation of the alpha-helix, and
              that hydrophobic interactions are also playing a role in its
              stabilization. At 30 degrees C, the calorimetric enthalpy and
              entropy values are estimated to be 650(+/-50) cal mol(-1)and
              2.0(+/-0.2) cal K(-1)mole(-1), respectively, per residue of this

              contribution of non-polar groups to the stabilization of the
              alpha-helix is insignificant and the estimated transition
              enthalpy can be assigned to the hydrogen bonds. With increasing
              temperature, the increasing magnitude of the negative enthalpy of
              hydration of the exposed polar groups should decrease the
              helix-stabilizing enthalpy of the backbone hydrogen bonds.
              However, the helix-stabilizing negative entropy of hydration of

               a force above 1,500 pN is applied; the second type, arising in a

  author   = "Evans, E and Ritchie, K",
  abstract = "In biology, molecular linkages at, within, and beneath cell
              interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These
              bonds will fail under any level of pulling force if held for
              sufficient time. Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force
              probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength of
              adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent
              properties. To examine what can be learned from measurements of
              bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory for reaction
              kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and tested
              the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics)
              simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the
              force that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests
              of breakage, i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture
              forces. As verified by the simulations, theory shows that bond
              strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of loading
              rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading
              (> or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent
              enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In the
              slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength
              grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial
              coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates,
              there is crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues
              to increase as the logarithm of the loading rate over many
              decades independent of the type of attraction. Finally, at
              ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of molecular
              dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly
              overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked
              frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation.
              Hence, to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength,
              molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span
              of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the
              time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the

              two-dimensional liquid-crystal phases, which accentuate the

              self-assembled structures on mica: designed end-to-end

              optimization, and finally the delivery of new drug candidates
              more quickly and at lower cost. Structure-based computational
              methods for drug discovery mainly involve ligand-protein docking
              and rapid binding free energy estimation, both of which require
              force field parameterization for many drug candidates. Here, we
              present a fast force field generation tool, called SwissParam,
              able to generate, for arbitrary small organic molecule,
              topologies, and parameters based on the Merck molecular force
              field, but in a functional form that is compatible with the
              CHARMM force field. Output files can be used with CHARMM or
              GROMACS. The topologies and parameters generated by SwissParam
              are used by the docking software EADock2 and EADock DSS to
              describe the small molecules to be docked, whereas the protein is
              described by the CHARMM force field, and allow them to reach
              success rates ranging from 56 to 78\%. We have also developed a
              rapid binding free energy estimation approach, using SwissParam
              for ligands and CHARMM22/27 for proteins, which requires only a

              avidin and streptavidin, achieving femtomolar and picomolar

              because biotin achieves this with a meagre molecular weight of
              240 Da. Surprisingly, the approaches by which biotin achieves
              this are not in the standard repertoire of current medicinal
              chemistry practice. Biotin's biggest lesson is the importance of
              nonclassical H-bonds in protein-ligand complexes. Most of
              biotin's affinity stems from its flexible valeric acid side chain
              that forms CH-$\pi$, CH-O, and classical H-bonds with the
              lipophilic region of the binding pocket. Biotin also utilizes an
              oxyanion hole, a sulfur-centered H-bond, and water solvation in
              the bound state to achieve its potency. The facets and advantages

              molecule is accompanied by folding, with a variety of bound
              conformations often being allowed in formation of the complex. In

              molecules, S100B, as a representative IDR. Although the 3D

               SHAKE and RATTLE. We implemented this algorithm in the SPASMS
               package of molecular mechanics and dynamics. Several series of
               molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to examine the
               performance of the new algorithm in comparison with the original
               RATTLE method. It was found that SETTLE is of higher accuracy
               and is faster than RATTLE with reasonable tolerances by three to
               nine times on a scalar machine. Furthermore, the performance
               improvement ranged from factors of 26 to 98 on a vector machine
               since the method presented is not iterative. \copyright{} 1992

  abstract = "We recently reported the engineering of monomeric streptavidin,
              mSA, corresponding to one subunit of wild type (wt) streptavidin
              tetramer. The monomer was designed by homology modeling, in which
              the streptavidin and rhizavidin sequences were combined to
              engineer a high affinity binding pocket containing residues from
              a single subunit only. Although mSA is stable and binds biotin
              with nanomolar affinity, its fast off rate (koff ) creates
              practical challenges during applications. We obtained a 1.9 {\AA}
              crystal structure of mSA bound to biotin to understand their
              interaction in detail, and used the structure to introduce
              targeted mutations to improve its binding kinetics. To this end,
              we compared mSA to shwanavidin, which contains a hydrophobic lid
              containing F43 in the binding pocket and binds biotin tightly.
              However, the T48F mutation in mSA, which introduces a comparable
              hydrophobic lid, only resulted in a modest 20-40\% improvement in
              the measured koff . On the other hand, introducing the S25H
              mutation near the bicyclic ring of bound biotin increased the
              dissociation half life (t½ ) from 11 to 83 min at 20°C. Molecular
              dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that H25 stabilizes the binding
              loop L3,4 by interacting with A47, and protects key
              intermolecular hydrogen bonds by limiting solvent entry into the
              binding pocket. Concurrent T48F or T48W mutation clashes with H25
              and partially abrogates the beneficial effects of H25. Taken
              together, this study suggests that stabilization of the binding
              loop and solvation of the binding pocket are important
              determinants of the dissociation kinetics in mSA.",

              It is unclear how easily influenza virus might escape such
              antibodies if there was strong pressure to do so. Here, we map
              all single amino-acid mutations that increase resistance to broad
              antibodies to H1 hemagglutinin. Our approach not only identifies
              antigenic mutations but also quantifies their effect sizes. All

              The virus can escape a broad antibody to hemagglutinin's
              receptor-binding site the same way it escapes narrow
              strain-specific antibodies: via single mutations with huge

              of drug design this approach has only recently attached attention
              of researchers. The main idea of using SMD to screen out leads is
              based on the hypothesis that the larger is the force needed to
              unbind a ligand from a receptor the higher its binding affinity.
              Thus, instead of binding free energy, the rupture force defined
              as the maximum on the force-time/displacement profile, is used as
              a score function. In this mini-review, we discuss basic concepts
              behind the experimental technique atomic force microscopy as well
              as SMD. Experimental and theoretical works on the application of

               quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM)
               calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and
               proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were
               combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in
               crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of
               the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the
               LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were
               determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these
               molecules. The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all
               three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of
               the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter
               optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension
               of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone
               phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy
               correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven
               proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate
               the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and
               crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of
               the phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based
               energy correction were required to yield significant
               improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic
               deviations in the treatment of phi and psi in the helical and
               sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments
               were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and
               glycine to account for these systematic differences. These
               adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two

              experiment. A growing number of these studies have reported
              distinctly nonlinear trends in rupture force with loading rate
              that are typically explained in conventional models by invoking
              complex escape pathways. Recent analyses suggested that these
              trends should be expected even for simple barriers based on the
              basic assumptions of bond rupture dynamics and thus may represent
              the norm rather than the exception. Here we explore how these
              nonlinear trends reflect the two fundamental regimes of bond
              rupture: (i) a near-equilibrium regime, produced either by bond
              reforming in the case of a single bond or by asynchronized
              rupture of multiple individual bonds, and (ii) a kinetic regime
              produced by fast, non-equilibrium bond rupture. We analyze both
              single- and multi-bonded cases, describe the full evolution of
              the system as it transitions between near- and
              far-from-equilibrium loading regimes, and show that both
              interpretations produce essentially identical force spectra. Data
              from 10 different molecular systems show that this model provides
              a comprehensive description of force spectra for a diverse suite
              of bonds over experimentally relevant loading rates, removes the
              inconsistencies of previous interpretations of transition state
              distances, and gives ready access to both kinetic and

              different force-loading rates into the force-dependent lifetimes
              measurable in constant-force experiments. To interpret the

              lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model

              unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached

              generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of
              organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is
              to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G*
              electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying
              electronic structure features, including formal charge and
              electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population
              charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then
              applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC
              charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting
              to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of >2700 molecules. Most
              organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as
              well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic
              heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the
              AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic
              compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database.
              Validation of the model was done through comparisons of
              hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of
              solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994
              Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.(13) Homo- and hetero-dimer
              hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were
              reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab
              initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9
              kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated
              relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of
              monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol
              of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the
              AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above
              0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the
              AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative

              to identify collective variables \{xi\} = x, which can be used to
              construct the free energy landscape $\Delta$G(x) of a molecular
              system. While PCA is routinely applied to equilibrium molecular
              dynamics (MD) simulations, it is less obvious as to how to extend
              the approach to nonequilibrium simulation techniques. This
              includes, e.g., the definition of the statistical averages
              employed in PCA as well as the relation between the equilibrium
              free energy landscape $\Delta$G(x) and the energy landscapes
              $\Delta$G(x) obtained from nonequilibrium MD. As an example for a
              nonequilibrium method, ``targeted MD'' is considered which
              employs a moving distance constraint to enforce rare transitions
              along some biasing coordinate s. The introduced bias can be
              described by a weighting function P(s), which provides a direct
              relation between equilibrium and nonequilibrium data, and thus
              establishes a well-defined way to perform PCA on nonequilibrium
              data. While the resulting distribution P(x) and energy
              $\Delta$G∝lnP will not reflect the equilibrium state of the
              system, the nonequilibrium energy landscape $\Delta$G(x) may
              directly reveal the molecular reaction mechanism. Applied to
              targeted MD simulations of the unfolding of decaalanine, for
              example, a PCA performed on backbone dihedral angles is shown to
              discriminate several unfolding pathways. Although the formulation
              is in principle exact, its practical use depends critically on
              the choice of the biasing coordinate s, which should account for

               simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in
               space in such a way to approximately represent the system's
               overall structure. In order that the simulations are not
               disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms
               from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances.
               Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a
               packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial
               constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the
               distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater
               than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to
               pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex
               molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The
               regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders,
               planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of
               one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that
               each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures,
               interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or
               mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different
               atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to
               different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered
               molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid
               double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art

              this challenge, we have developed a new computational method,
              ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD), which
              selectively boosts the ligand nonbonded interaction potential
              energy based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics

              in a dual-boost algorithm (LiGaMD\_Dual) to facilitate ligand

              protein-ligand binding model systems. Repetitive guest binding
              and unbinding in the $\beta$-cyclodextrin host were observed in
              hundreds-of-nanosecond LiGaMD\_Dual simulations. The calculated
              guest binding free energies agreed excellently with experimental

  abstract  = "Adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD) is a variant of
               steered molecular dynamics (SMD) in which the driving of the
               auxiliary ? viz steered ? particle is performed in stages. In
               SMD, many nonequilibrium trajectories are generated allowing for
               fast sampling of the ensemble space and access to rare events.
               Equilibrium observables, such as the potential of mean force
               along the pathway, result from averaging over these trajectories
               using Jarzynski's Equality (JE). Unfortunately, in SMD, a large
               number of trajectories are needed to cover all possible
               configurations in order to obtain converged quantities in the
               exponential average of the JE, and this is computationally
               expensive. ASMD reduces the number of trajectories that must be
               sampled by discarding those trajectories that have deviated far
               from the equilibrium path in stages. At the end of a stage, one
               chooses ? or contracts ? one (in na{\"\i}ve ASMD) or some (in
               multi-branched ASMD or MB-ASMD) of the configurations produced
               from the previous stage to initiate the trajectories in the next
               stage. Alternatively, in full-relaxation ASMD (FR-ASMD), all
               generated structures are relaxed under the constraint of a fixed
               auxiliary particle exerting no net work on the system. We
               provide a direct comparison of the energetics and other
               observables obtained from these approaches. We find that FR-ASMD
               is preferred when the unfolding pathways follow up along a
               single funnel and the system is sufficiently small that
               computational resources are not a limiting concern. It gives the
               highest accuracy in such cases while avoiding the inefficiencies
               of SMD. However, for complex energy landscapes typical of most
               multi-domain proteins, MB-ASMD is preferred because it provides
               a mechanism to sample alternative pathways while suffering only
               a modest loss in accuracy compared to FR-ASMD.",

               nonlinear fitting of the time-dependent relative abundances of

              an inhibitor is in complex with its target, is a fundamental part
              of the drug discovery process. Synthesis and experimental
              measurements of kinetic rate constants are, however, expensive
              and time consuming. In this work, we aimed to obtain drug
              residence times computationally. Furthermore, we propose a novel
              algorithm to identify molecular design objectives based on ligand
              unbinding kinetics. We designed an enhanced sampling technique to
              accurately predict the free-energy profiles of the ligand
              unbinding process, focusing on the free-energy barrier for
              unbinding. Our method first identifies unbinding paths
              determining a corresponding set of internal coordinates (ICs)
              that form contacts between the protein and the ligand; it then
              iteratively updates these interactions during a series of biased
              molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the ICs that are
              important for the whole of the unbinding process. Subsequently,
              we performed finite-temperature string simulations to obtain the
              free-energy barrier for unbinding using the set of ICs as a
              complex reaction coordinate. Importantly, we also aimed to enable
              the further design of drugs focusing on improved residence times.
              To this end, we developed a supervised machine learning (ML)
              approach with inputs from unbiased ``downhill'' trajectories
              initiated near the transition state (TS) ensemble of the string
              unbinding path. We demonstrate that our ML method can identify
              key ligand-protein interactions driving the system through the
              TS. Some of the most important drugs for cancer treatment are
              kinase inhibitors. One of these kinase targets is
              cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), an appealing target for
              anticancer drug development. Here, we tested our method using two
              different CDK2 inhibitors for the potential further development
              of these compounds. We compared the free-energy barriers obtained
              from our calculations with those observed in available
              experimental data. We highlighted important interactions at the
              distal ends of the ligands that can be targeted for improved
              residence times. Our method provides a new tool to determine
              unbinding rates and to identify key structural features of the
              inhibitors that can be used as starting points for novel design
              strategies in drug discovery.",

              moving distance constraint to enforce rare transitions along some

              Poisson-Boltzmann or generalized Born and surface area continuum
              solvation (MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA) methods are popular approaches to
              estimate the free energy of the binding of small ligands to
              biological macromolecules. They are typically based on molecular
              dynamics simulations of the receptor-ligand complex and are
              therefore intermediate in both accuracy and computational effort
              between empirical scoring and strict alchemical perturbation
              methods. They have been applied to a large number of systems with
              varying success. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the use of
              MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA methods to calculate ligand-binding
              affinities, with an emphasis on calibration, testing and
              validation, as well as attempts to improve the methods, rather
              than on specific applications. EXPERT OPINION: MM/PBSA and
              MM/GBSA are attractive approaches owing to their modular nature
              and that they do not require calculations on a training set. They
              have been used successfully to reproduce and rationalize
              experimental findings and to improve the results of virtual
              screening and docking. However, they contain several crude and
              questionable approximations, for example, the lack of
              conformational entropy and information about the number and free
              energy of water molecules in the binding site. Moreover, there
              are many variants of the method and their performance varies

  title    = "Analysis and elimination of a bias in targeted molecular dynamics
              simulations of conformational transitions: application to
              calmodulin",
  author   = "Ovchinnikov, Victor and Karplus, Martin",
  abstract = "The popular targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) method for
              generating transition paths in complex biomolecular systems is
              revisited. In a typical TMD transition path, the large-scale
              changes occur early and the small-scale changes tend to occur
              later. As a result, the order of events in the computed paths
              depends on the direction in which the simulations are performed.
              To identify the origin of this bias, and to propose a method in
              which the bias is absent, variants of TMD in the restraint
              formulation are introduced and applied to the complex open ↔
              closed transition in the protein calmodulin. Due to the global
              best-fit rotation that is typically part of the TMD method, the
              simulated system is guided implicitly along the lowest-frequency
              normal modes, until the large spatial scales associated with
              these modes are near the target conformation. The remaining
              portion of the transition is described progressively by
              higher-frequency modes, which correspond to smaller-scale
              rearrangements. A straightforward modification of TMD that avoids
              the global best-fit rotation is the locally restrained TMD
              (LRTMD) method, in which the biasing potential is constructed
              from a number of TMD potentials, each acting on a small connected
              portion of the protein sequence. With a uniform distribution of
              these elements, transition paths that lack the length-scale bias
              are obtained. Trajectories generated by steered MD in dihedral
              angle space (DSMD), a method that avoids best-fit rotations
              altogether, also lack the length-scale bias. To examine the
              importance of the paths generated by TMD, LRTMD, and DSMD in the
              actual transition, we use the finite-temperature string method to
              compute the free energy profile associated with a transition tube
              around a path generated by each algorithm. The free energy
              barriers associated with the paths are comparable, suggesting
              that transitions can occur along each route with similar
              probabilities. This result indicates that a broad ensemble of
              paths needs to be calculated to obtain a full description of
              conformational changes in biomolecules. The breadth of the
              contributing ensemble suggests that energetic barriers for
              conformational transitions in proteins are offset by entropic
              contributions that arise from a large number of possible paths.",

               are parallel to the mean force at every nonstationary point of
               the free energy landscape. In contrast to adiabatic paths, which
               are parallel to the force, OFEPs include the effect of entropy
               and are relevant even for systems with diffusive degrees of
               freedom. In this study the OFEPs are computed for the alanine
               dipeptide in solution. The potential of mean force is calculated
               and an effective potential is derived that is used to obtain the
               paths with a minimization based algorithm. The comparison of the
               calculated paths with the adiabatic paths in vacuo shows the
               influence of the environment on conformational transitions. The
               dynamics of the alanine dipeptide in water are more complex,
               since there are more minima and the barriers are lower. Two
               simpler methods for the calculation of reaction pathways in
               solution are evaluated by comparing their results with the
               OFEPs. In the first method the mean electrostatic field of the
               water is approximated by an analytical continuum model. The
               obtained paths show qualitative agreement with the OFEPs and the
               height of the barriers are similar. Targeted molecular dynamics
               (TMD), the second approach, constrains the distance to a target
               conformation to accelerate the transition. In the general case,
               however, it is difficult to assess the physical significance of
               the obtained paths. Changing the initial conditions by assigning
               different velocities leads to different solutions for the
               conformational transition. Furthermore, it is shown that by
               performing the simulations with different reaction coordinates
               or in opposite directions different pathways are preferred. This
               result can be explained by the structure of the free energy
               landscape around the initial conformations. In a first
               approximation the physical significance of different pathways is
               assumed to depend mainly on the free energy at the highest
               saddle point. In the literature the total energy of the system
               has often been used to estimate the position and the height of
               the energy barriers in the path. By comparing the total energy
               with the calculated free energy it is shown that the former
               largely overestimates the height of the barriers. Furthermore,
               the positions of the maxima of the total energy do not coincide
               with the free energy barriers. Simple approximations to the free
               energy lead to good quantitative agreement.",

              glucose metabolism. An unusual mechanism of positive
              cooperativity of monomeric GK containing only a single binding
              site for glucose is very interesting and still unclear. The
              activation process of GK is associated with a large-scale
              conformational change from the inactive to the active state.
              Here, conventional and targeted molecular dynamics simulations
              were used to study the conformational dynamics of GK in the
              stable configurations and in the transition from active to
              inactive state. Three phases of the structural reorganization of
              GK were detected. The first step is a transformation of GK from
              the active state to the intermediate structure, where the cleft
              between the domains is open, but alpha helix 13 is still inside
              the small domain. From this point, there are two alternative
              paths. One path leads to the inactive state through the release
              of helix 13 from the inside of small domain to the outside. Other
              path goes back to the active state. Simulation results reveal the
              critical role of helix 13 in the transformation of GK from the
              open state to inactive one and the influence of the loop 2 on the
              protein transformation between the open and the closed active

               conformations in vivo: (1) a monomeric form called the PP-fold
               in which a polyproline tail is folded onto an $\alpha$-helix via
               a $\beta$-turn and (2) a dimeric form of the unfolded proteins
               in which the $\alpha$-helices interact with each other via side
               chains. The transition pathway and rates between the two
               conformations remain unknown and are important to the nature of
               the binding of the protein. Toward addressing this question, the
               present work suggests that the unfolding of the PP-fold is too
               slow to play a role in NPY monomeric binding unless the receptor
               catalyzes it to do so. Specifically, the dynamics and structural
               changes of the unfolding of a monomeric NPY protein have been
               investigated in this work. Temperature accelerated molecular
               dynamics (MD) simulations at 500 K under constant (N,V,E)
               conditions suggests a hinge-like unraveling of the tail rather
               than a random unfolding. The free energetics of the proposed
               unfolding pathway have been described using an adaptive steered
               MD (SMD) approach at various temperatures. This approach
               generalizes the use of Jarzynski's equality through a series of
               stages that allows for better convergence along nonlinear and
               long-distance pathways. Results acquired using this approach
               provide a potential of mean force (PMF) with narrower error bars

              has been the extraction of information from such simulations that

              membrane-bound receptors to control processes such as food
              intake, vasoconstriction, and memory retention. The N-terminal
              polyproline sequence of NPY folds back onto a C-terminal
              $\alpha$-helix to form a hairpin structure. The hairpin undergoes
              transient unfolding to allow the monomer to interact with its

              solution. Using computational, functional, and biophysical
              approaches, we characterized the role of two conserved tyrosines
              (Y20 and Y27) located within the hydrophobic core of the hairpin
              fold. Successive mutation of the tyrosines to more hydrophobic

              predicting a more stable hairpin structure. However, mutant
              stability was high relative to wild-type: melting temperatures
              increased by approximately 20 °C for the single mutants (Y20F and
              Y27F) and by 30 °C for the double mutant (Y20F + Y27F). These
              findings suggested that the mutations were not just simply
              enhancing hairpin structure stability, but might also be driving
              self-association to dimer. Using analytical ultracentrifugation,
              we determined that the mutations indeed increased
              self-association, but shifted the equilibrium toward hexamer-like
              species. Notably, these latter species were not unique to the NPY
              mutants, but were found to preexist at low levels in the
              wild-type population. Collectively, the findings indicate that
              NPY self-association is more complex than previously recognized
              and that the ensemble of NPY quaternary states is tunable by
              modulating hairpin hydrophobicity.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: ACPYPE (or AnteChamber PYthon Parser interfacE) is a
              wrapper script around the ANTECHAMBER software that simplifies
              the generation of small molecule topologies and parameters for a
              variety of molecular dynamics programmes like GROMACS, CHARMM and
              CNS. It is written in the Python programming language and was
              developed as a tool for interfacing with other Python based
              applications such as the CCPN software suite (for NMR data
              analysis) and ARIA (for structure calculations from NMR data).
              ACPYPE is open source code, under GNU GPL v3, and is available as
              a stand-alone application at http://www.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype and as
              a web portal application at http://webapps.ccpn.ac.uk/acpype.
              FINDINGS: We verified the topologies generated by ACPYPE in three
              ways: by comparing with default AMBER topologies for standard
              amino acids; by generating and verifying topologies for a large
              set of ligands from the PDB; and by recalculating the structures
              for 5 protein-ligand complexes from the PDB. CONCLUSIONS: ACPYPE
              is a tool that simplifies the automatic generation of topology
              and parameters in different formats for different molecular
              mechanics programmes, including calculation of partial charges,

               protein solubility and structural stability are introduced. The

              and identified primary biological drivers of SARS-CoV-2

              transmissibility and resistance to population-level host immunity
              has waxed and waned as a primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution
              over time. We retroactively identified with high accuracy (area
              under the receiver operator characteristic curve,
              AUROC=0.92-0.97) mutations that will spread, at up to four months

              the quantities involved in the estimator are the work exponential
              averages related to the forward and backward directions of the

              Such free energy difference can be estimated without resorting to
              additional methodologies or data, but exploiting the available
              work measurements in the Bennett acceptance ratio method. Despite

               for both long polarizable and non-polarizable MD simulations of
               large proteins. To validate this new implementation, we first

               (AMOEBAPRO13 and AMOEBABIO18) force fields have been used. For
               each one of them, PMFs have been reconstructed and compared in
               terms of free energy barrier and hydrogen bonding fluctuations

               applied to a set of 20 trajectories, we show that polarizable

               could be anticipated, strong discrepancies are noticed between
               polarizable and non-polarizable models when considered in
               vacuum, whereas results are more comparable when a water
               environment is added. However, for the largest system, i.e., the

               salt bridge are noticed exhibiting some potential issues with

              type I transmembrane protein minK (KCNE1) to generate the slow
              delayed rectifier (IKs) current in the heart. Mutations in these
              transmembrane proteins have been linked with several
              heart-related issues, including long QT syndromes (LQTS),
              congenital atrial fibrillation, and short QT syndrome. Off-target
              interactions of several drugs with that of KCNQ1/KCNE1 ion
              channel complex have been known to cause fatal cardiac
              irregularities. Thus, KCNQ1/KCNE1 remains an important avenue for
              drug-design and discovery research. In this work, we present the
              structural and mechanistic details of potassium ion permeation
              through an open KCNQ1 structural model using the combined
              molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics simulations. We
              discuss the processes and key residues involved in the permeation
              of a potassium ion through the KCNQ1 ion channel, and how the ion
              permeation is affected by (i) the KCNQ1-KCNE1 interactions and
              (ii) the binding of chromanol 293B ligand and its derivatives
              into the complex. The results reveal that interactions between
              KCNQ1 with KCNE1 causes a pore constriction in the former, which
              in-turn forms small energetic barriers in the ion-permeation
              pathway. These findings correlate with the previous experimental
              reports that interactions of KCNE1 dramatically slows the
              activation of KCNQ1. Upon ligand-binding onto the complex, the
              energy-barriers along ion permeation path are more pronounced, as
              expected, therefore, requiring higher force in our steered-MD
              simulations. Nevertheless, pulling the ion when a weak blocker is
              bound to the channel does not necessitate high force in SMD. This
              indicates that our SMD simulations have been able to discern
              between strong and week blockers and reveal their influence on
              potassium ion permeation. The findings presented here will have
              some implications in understanding the potential off-target
              interactions of the drugs with the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel that lead
              to cardiotoxic effects.",

               by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth biomolecular
               potential energy surface and reduce energy barriers. GaMD
               greatly accelerates biomolecular simulations by orders of
               magnitude. Without the need to set predefined reaction
               coordinates or collective variables, GaMD provides unconstrained

               biological processes. The GaMD boost potential exhibits a
               Gaussian distribution, thereby allowing for energetic
               reweighting via cumulant expansion to the second order (i.e.,
               ``Gaussian approximation''). This leads to accurate
               reconstruction of free energy landscapes of biomolecules. Hybrid
               schemes with other enhanced sampling methods, such as the

               cannot be simulated directly using molecular dynamics because of
               nanosecond time scale limitations. These systems are trapped in
               potential energy minima with high free energy barriers for large
               numbers of computational steps. The dynamic evolution of many
               molecular systems occurs through a series of rare events as the
               system moves from one potential energy basin to another.
               Therefore, we have proposed a robust bias potential function
               that can be used in an efficient accelerated molecular dynamics
               approach to simulate the transition of high energy barriers

               potential energy wells or saddle points. In this method, the

               wells are enhanced, which accelerates and extends the time scale
               in molecular dynamics simulations. Our definition of the bias

               potential energy minima to be well defined, and hence properly

               within the same framework, acceleration of rare events and
               estimation of the free energy of complex molecular systems. It
               is based on iteratively `filling' the potential energy of the
               system by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory
               followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs),
               thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the
               next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large
               number of extensions and variants that have been developed. The
               first scope of this Technical Review is to present a critical
               comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and
               disadvantages. The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of
               the numerous alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the
               choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the
               resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and
               predicted transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The
               second scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs
               should be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are
               sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs

              Implementations of various collective variables and enhanced
              sampling techniques. Reasons for new version: The old version was
              difficult to maintain and its design was not as flexible as this
              new version. This lack of flexibility made it difficult to
              implement a number of novel methods that have emerged since the
              release of the original code. Summary of revisions: The new
              version of the code has a completely redesigned architecture,
              which allows for several important enhancements. This allows for
              a much simpler and robust input syntax and for improved
              performance. In addition, it provides several, more-complex
              collective variables which could not have been written using the
              previous implementation. Furthermore, the entire code is fully
              documented so it is easier to extend. Finally, the code is
              designed so that users can implement new variables directly in
              the input files and thus develop bespoke applications of these
              powerful algorithms. Unusual features: PLUMED 2 can be used
              either as a standalone program, e.g. for a posteriori analysis of
              trajectories, or as a library embedded in a molecular dynamics
              code (such as GROMACS, NAMD, Quantum ESPRESSO, and LAMMPS).
              Interfaces with these particular codes are provided in patches,
              which a simple script will insert into the underlying molecular
              dynamics codes source code files. For other molecular dynamics
              codes there is extensive documentation on how to add PLUMED in
              our manual. Additional comments: The distribution file contains a
              test suite, user and developer documentation and a collection of
              patches and utilities. Running time: Depends on the number of
              atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. The
              regression test suite provided takes approximately 1 min to run.",

              to a GPCR protein, human endothelin receptor type B (hETB).
              GA-mD-VcMD is a generalized ensemble method that produces a
              free-energy landscape of the ligand-receptor binding by searching
              large-scale motions accompanied with stable maintenance of the
              fragile cell-membrane structure. All molecular components
              (bosentan, hETB, membrane, and solvent) were represented with an
              all-atom model. Then sampling was conducted from conformations
              where bosentan was distant from the binding site in the hETB
              binding pocket. The deepest basin in the resultant free-energy
              landscape was assigned to native-like complex conformation. The
              following binding mechanism was inferred. First, bosentan
              fluctuating randomly in solution is captured using a tip region
              of the flexible N-terminal tail of hETB via nonspecific
              attractive interactions (fly casting). Bosentan then slides
              occasionally from the tip to the root of the N-terminal tail
              (ligand-sliding). During this sliding, bosentan passes the gate
              of the binding pocket from outside to inside of the pocket with
              an accompanying rapid reduction of the molecular orientational
              variety of bosentan (orientational selection). Last, in the
              pocket, ligand-receptor attractive native contacts are formed.
              Eventually, the native-like complex is completed. The
              bosentan-captured conformations by the tip-region and root-region
              of the N-terminal tail correspond to two basins in the
              free-energy landscape. The ligand-sliding corresponds to
              overcoming of a free-energy barrier between the basins.",

              Considering the distribution P( x ) of the CVs, the primal goal
              of a statistical analysis is to detect the characteristic
              features of P( x ), in particular, its maxima and their
              connection paths. This is because these features characterize the
              low-energy regions and the energy barriers of the corresponding
              free energy landscape $\Delta$G( x ) = -k B T ln P( x ), and
              therefore amount to the metastable states and transition regions

               inhibits its anticancer activity, which leads to promotion of
               tumor cell growth and tumor survival. Abrogation of the p53:MDM2
               interaction reportedly results in reactivation of the p53
               pathway and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. We recently
               performed rigorous selection of MDM2-binding peptides by means
               of mRNA display and identified an optimal 12-mer peptide
               (PRFWEYWLRLME), named MDM2 Inhibitory Peptide (MIP), which shows
               higher affinity for MDM2 (and also its homolog, MDMX) and higher
               tumor cell proliferation suppression activity than known
               peptides. Here we determined the NMR solution structure of a
               MIP-MDM2 fusion protein to elucidate the structural basis of the
               tight binding of MIP to MDM2. A region spanning from Phe3 to
               Met11 of MIP forms a single $\alpha$-helix, which is longer than
               those of the other MDM2-binding peptides. MIP shares a conserved
               Phe3-Trp7-Leu10 triad, whose side chains are oriented towards
               and fit into the hydrophobic pockets of MDM2. Additionally,
               hydrophobic surface patches that surround the hydrophobic
               pockets of MDM2 are covered by solvent-exposed MIP residues,
               Trp4, Tyr6, and Met11. Their hydrophobic interactions extend the
               interface of the two molecules and contribute to the strong
               binding. The potential MDM2 inhibition activity observed for MIP
               turned out to originate from its enlarged binding interface. The
               structural information obtained in the present study provides a
               road map for the rational design of strong inhibitors of

              Computational models for interpreting the quantitative
              structure-kinetics relationship (QSKR) aim at predicting
              protein-ligand binding/unbinding kinetics based on protein
              structure, ligand structure, or their complex structure, which in
              principle can provide a more rational basis for structure-based
              drug design. Thus far, most of the public data sets used for
              deriving such QSKR models are rather limited in sample size and
              structural diversity. To tackle this problem, we have compiled a
              set of 680 protein-ligand complexes with experimental
              dissociation rate constants (k off), which were mainly curated
              from the references accumulated for updating our PDBbind
              database. Three-dimensional structure of each protein-ligand
              complex in this data set was either retrieved from the Protein
              Data Bank or carefully modeled based on a proper template. The
              entire data set covers 155 types of protein, with their
              dissociation kinetic constants (k off) spanning nearly 10 orders
              of magnitude. To the best of our knowledge, this data set is the
              largest of its kind reported publicly. Utilizing this data set,
              we derived a random forest (RF) model based on protein-ligand

              demonstrated that utilizing modeled structures as additional

              biological phenomena, roles that range from stabilization of
              biomolecular structure, to influence on biomolecular dynamics, to
              key physiological influence on homeostasis and signaling. To
              properly model ionic interaction and stability in atomistic
              simulations of biomolecular structure, dynamics, folding,
              catalysis, and function, an accurate model or representation of
              the monovalent ions is critically necessary. A good model needs
              to simultaneously reproduce many properties of ions, including
              their structure, dynamics, solvation, and moreover both the
              interactions of these ions with each other in the crystal and in
              solution and the interactions of ions with other molecules. At
              present, the best force fields for biomolecules employ a simple
              additive, nonpolarizable, and pairwise potential for atomic
              interaction. In this work, we describe our efforts to build
              better models of the monovalent ions within the pairwise
              Coulombic and 6-12 Lennard-Jones framework, where the models are
              tuned to balance crystal and solution properties in Ewald
              simulations with specific choices of well-known water models.
              Although it has been clearly demonstrated that truly accurate
              treatments of ions will require inclusion of nonadditivity and
              polarizability (particularly with the anions) and ultimately even
              a quantum mechanical treatment, our goal was to simply push the
              limits of the additive treatments to see if a balanced model
              could be created. The applied methodology is general and can be
              extended to other ions and to polarizable force-field models. Our
              starting point centered on observations from long simulations of
              biomolecules in salt solution with the AMBER force fields where
              salt crystals formed well below their solubility limit. The
              likely cause of the artifact in the AMBER parameters relates to
              the naive mixing of the Smith and Dang chloride parameters with
              AMBER-adapted Aqvist cation parameters. To provide a more
              appropriate balance, we reoptimized the parameters of the
              Lennard-Jones potential for the ions and specific choices of
              water models. To validate and optimize the parameters, we
              calculated hydration free energies of the solvated ions and also
              lattice energies (LE) and lattice constants (LC) of alkali halide
              salt crystals. This is the first effort that systematically scans
              across the Lennard-Jones space (well depth and radius) while
              balancing ion properties like LE and LC across all pair
              combinations of the alkali ions and halide ions. The optimization
              across the entire monovalent series avoids systematic deviations.
              The ion parameters developed, optimized, and characterized were
              targeted for use with some of the most commonly used rigid and
              nonpolarizable water models, specifically TIP3P, TIP4P EW, and
              SPC/E. In addition to well reproducing the solution and crystal
              properties, the new ion parameters well reproduce binding
              energies of the ions to water and the radii of the first
              hydration shells.",

              disordered states using experimental methods can be challenging,
              since they are composed of a structurally heterogeneous ensemble
              of conformations rather than a single dominant conformation.
              Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle provide
              an ideal tool for elucidating the composition and behavior of
              disordered states at an atomic level of detail. Unfortunately, MD
              simulations using current physics-based models tend to produce
              disordered-state ensembles that are structurally too compact
              relative to experiments. We find that the water models typically
              used in MD simulations significantly underestimate London
              dispersion interactions, and speculate that this may be a
              possible reason for these erroneous results. To test this
              hypothesis, we create a new water model, TIP4P-D, that
              approximately corrects for these deficiencies in modeling water
              dispersion interactions while maintaining compatibility with
              existing physics-based models. We show that simulations of

              product is produced industrially using these enzymes, the
              production of non-target products (byproducts) causes adverse
              effects such as increased processing costs for purification and

              site prediction for enhancing the regioselectivity of substrate

              docking poses of an enzyme and a substrate as input and

                   stochastic sampling methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo
                   (MCMC) or Langevin Dynamics (LD) can suffer from slow mixing

                   in order to learn the transformation of a simple prior
                   distribution to the given target distribution. Here we
                   propose a generalized and combined approach to sample target
                   densities: Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF) -- an
                   arbitrary sequence of deterministic invertible functions and
                   stochastic sampling blocks. We show that stochasticity
                   overcomes expressivity limitations of normalizing flows
                   resulting from the invertibility constraint, whereas
                   trainable transformations between sampling steps improve
                   efficiency of pure MCMC/LD along the flow. By invoking ideas

                   which we can compute exact importance weights without having
                   to marginalize out the randomness of the stochastic blocks.

              represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein
              sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months
              to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single
              protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed
              to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural
              bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a

              of prediction accuracy. A significant epoch in structural
              bioinformatics was the structural annotation of over 98\% of
              protein sequences in the human proteome. Interestingly, many
              predictions feature regions of very low confidence, and these
              regions largely overlap with intrinsically disordered regions
              (IDRs). That over 30\% of regions within the proteome are
              disordered is congruent with estimates that have been made over

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Although structural domains in proteins (SDs) are
              important, half of the regions in the human proteome are
              currently left with no SD assignments. These unassigned regions
              consist not only of novel SDs, but also of intrinsically
              disordered (ID) regions since proteins, especially those in
              eukaryotes, generally contain a significant fraction of ID
              regions. As ID regions can be inferred from amino acid sequences,
              a method that combines SD and ID region assignments can determine
              the fractions of SDs and ID regions in any proteome. RESULTS: In
              contrast to other available ID prediction programs that merely
              identify likely ID regions, the DICHOT system we previously
              developed classifies the entire protein sequence into SDs and ID
              regions. Application of DICHOT to the human proteome revealed
              that residue-wise ID regions constitute 35\%, SDs with similarity
              to PDB structures comprise 52\%, while SDs with no similarity to
              PDB structures account for the remaining 13\%. The last group
              consists of novel structural domains, termed cryptic domains,
              which serve as good targets of structural genomics. The DICHOT
              method applied to the proteomes of other model organisms
              indicated that eukaryotes generally have high ID contents, while
              prokaryotes do not. In human proteins, ID contents differ among
              subcellular localizations: nuclear proteins had the highest
              residue-wise ID fraction (47\%), while mitochondrial proteins
              exhibited the lowest (13\%). Phosphorylation and O-linked
              glycosylation sites were found to be located preferentially in ID
              regions. As O-linked glycans are attached to residues in the
              extracellular regions of proteins, the modification is likely to
              protect the ID regions from proteolytic cleavage in the
              extracellular environment. Alternative splicing events tend to
              occur more frequently in ID regions. We interpret this as
              evidence that natural selection is operating at the protein level
              in alternative splicing. CONCLUSIONS: We classified entire
              regions of proteins into the two categories, SDs and ID regions
              and thereby obtained various kinds of complete genome-wide

              of the virus as well as the efficacy of therapeutic
              interventions. Here, we predict the mutability of all positions
              in SARS-CoV-2 protein domains to forecast the appearance of
              unseen variants. Using sequence data from other coronaviruses,
              preexisting to SARS-CoV-2, we build statistical models that not
              only capture amino acid conservation but also more complex
              patterns resulting from epistasis. We show that these models are
              notably superior to conservation profiles in estimating the
              already observable SARS-CoV-2 variability. In the receptor
              binding domain of the spike protein, we observe that the

  abstract  = "Physical chemistry lies at the heart of the behaviour of those
               macromolecules and molecular assemblies that have vital roles in
               all living organisms. Physical principles determine the
               stability of proteins and nucleic acids, the rate at which
               biochemical reactions proceed, the transport of molecules across
               biological molecules; they allow us to describe structure and
               reactivity in complex biological systems, and make sense of how
               these systems operate. Physical Chemistry for the Life Sciences
               provides a balanced presentation of the concepts of physical
               chemistry, and their extensive applications to biology and
               biochemistry. It is written to straddle the worlds of physical
               chemistry and the life sciences and to show students how the
               tools of physical chemistry can elucidate and illuminate
               biological questions. Opening with a suite of chapters on
               Biochemical Thermodynamics, with a focus on energy conversion in
               biological cells and the factors that stabilize proteins,
               nucleic acids, and cell membranes, the book goes on to explore
               the Kinetics of Life Processes, examining the rates of chemical
               reactions, how rates can help characterise the mechanism of a
               reaction, and how enzymes affect reaction rates. A third
               section, Biomolecular Structure, looks at how concepts of
               physical chemistry can be used to establish those 'rules' that
               govern the assembly of complex biological structures, while the
               final section, Biomolecular Spectroscopy, describes the major
               techniques in biochemistry that are being applied to help us to
               explore biochemical processes and systems ever further. Physical
               Chemistry for the Life Sciences places emphasis on clear
               explanations of difficult concepts, with an eye toward building
               insight into biochemical phenomena. An extensive range of
               learning features, including worked examples, illustrations,
               self-tests, and case studies, support student learning
               throughout, while special attention is given to providing
               extensive help to students with those mathematical concepts and
               techniques that are so central to a sound understanding of
               physical chemistry. Balancing clarity and rigor of exposition of

  author   = "Smith, Richard D and Carlson, Heather A",
  abstract = "Protein dynamics play an important role in small molecule binding
              and can pose a significant challenge in the identification of
              potential binding sites. Cryptic binding sites have been defined
              as sites which require significant rearrangement of the protein
              structure to become physically accessible to a ligand.
              Mixed-solvent MD (MixMD) is a computational protocol which maps
              the surface of the protein using molecular dynamics (MD) of the
              unbound protein solvated in a 5\% box of probe molecules with
              explicit water. This method has successfully identified known
              active and allosteric sites which did not require reorganization.
              In this study, we apply the MixMD protocol to identify known
              cryptic sites of 12 proteins characterized by a wide range of
              conformational changes. Of these 12 proteins, three require
              reorganization of side chains, five require loop movements, and
              four require movement of more significant structures such as
              whole helices. In five cases, we find that standard MixMD
              simulations are able to map the cryptic binding sites with at
              least one probe type. In two cases (guanylate kinase and TIE-2),
              accelerated MD, which increases sampling of torsional angles, was
              necessary to achieve mapping of portions of the cryptic binding
              site missed by standard MixMD. For more complex systems where
              movement of a helix or domain is necessary, MixMD was unable to
              map the binding site even with accelerated dynamics, possibly due
              to the limited timescale (100 ns for individual simulations). In
              general, similar conformational dynamics are observed in
              water-only simulations and those with probe molecules. This could
              imply that the probes are not driving opening events but rather
              take advantage of mapping sites that spontaneously open as part
              of their inherent conformational behavior. Finally, we show that
              docking to an ensemble of conformations from the standard MixMD
              simulations performs better than docking the apo crystal
              structure in nine cases and even better than half of the bound
              crystal structures. Poorer performance was seen in docking to
              ensembles of conformations from the accelerated MixMD

              determined structures, hold great potential as drug targets.
              However, cryptic pocket openings are often beyond the reach of
              conventional biomolecular simulations because certain cryptic
              pocket openings involve slow motions. Here, we investigate
              whether AlphaFold can be used to accelerate cryptic pocket
              discovery either by generating structures with open pockets
              directly or generating structures with partially open pockets
              that can be used as starting points for simulations. We use
              AlphaFold to generate ensembles for 10 known cryptic pocket
              examples, including five that were deposited after AlphaFold's
              training data were extracted from the PDB. We find that in 6 out
              of 10 cases AlphaFold samples the open state. For plasmepsin II,
              an aspartic protease from the causative agent of malaria,
              AlphaFold only captures a partial pocket opening. As a result, we
              ran simulations from an ensemble of AlphaFold-generated
              structures and show that this strategy samples cryptic pocket
              opening, even though an equivalent amount of simulations launched
              from a ligand-free experimental structure fails to do so. Markov
              state models (MSMs) constructed from the AlphaFold-seeded
              simulations quickly yield a free energy landscape of cryptic
              pocket opening that is in good agreement with the same landscape
              generated with well-tempered metadynamics. Taken together, our
              results demonstrate that AlphaFold has a useful role to play in
              cryptic pocket discovery but that many cryptic pockets may remain
              difficult to sample using AlphaFold alone.",

              visible crystallographically upon binding events. These sites
              have been shown to be druggable and might provide a rare
              opportunity to target difficult proteins. However, due to their
              hidden nature, they are difficult to find through experimental
              screening. Computational methods based on atomistic molecular
              simulations remain one of the best approaches to identify and
              characterize cryptic binding sites. However, not all methods are

               the ligand in the crystallographic binding pose and end with the

               physical system that develops with a predistributed fluctuating
               temperature, which allows enhanced sampling of the physical
               system. Since the total system is governed by a prescribed
               distribution, the equilibrium of the physical system is also
               reconstructed by reweighting. We have formulated a scheme for
               specifically setting the distribution of the dynamical inverse
               temperature and demonstrate the statistical relationship between
               the dynamical and physical temperatures. The statistical
               features, dynamical properties, and sampling abilities of the
               current method are demonstrated via the distributions,
               trajectories, dynamical correlations, and free energy landscapes
               for both a model system and a biomolecular system. These results
               indicated that the current coupled NH scheme works well.",

                   machine learning approaches, especially with deep generative
                   models. Inspired by the diffusion process in classical
                   non-equilibrium thermodynamics where heated particles will
                   diffuse from original states to a noise distribution, in
                   this paper, we propose a novel generative model named
                   GeoDiff for molecular conformation prediction. GeoDiff
                   treats each atom as a particle and learns to directly
                   reverse the diffusion process (i.e., transforming from a
                   noise distribution to stable conformations) as a Markov
                   chain. Modeling such a generation process is however very
                   challenging as the likelihood of conformations should be
                   roto-translational invariant. We theoretically show that
                   Markov chains evolving with equivariant Markov kernels can
                   induce an invariant distribution by design, and further
                   propose building blocks for the Markov kernels to preserve
                   the desirable equivariance property. The whole framework can
                   be efficiently trained in an end-to-end fashion by
                   optimizing a weighted variational lower bound to the
                   (conditional) likelihood. Experiments on multiple benchmarks

                   integrated with timesteps on the order of femtoseconds
                   ($1\textrm\{fs\}=10^\{-15\}\textrm\{s\}$). MD is often used
                   to compute equilibrium properties, which requires sampling
                   from an equilibrium distribution such as the Boltzmann
                   distribution. However, many important processes, such as
                   binding and folding, occur over timescales of milliseconds
                   or beyond, and cannot be efficiently sampled with
                   conventional MD. Furthermore, new MD simulations need to be
                   performed from scratch for each molecular system studied. We
                   present Timewarp, an enhanced sampling method which uses a

                   way to accelerate MD. Notwithstanding, existing models
                   depend on intermediate variables such as the potential
                   energy or force fields to update atomic positions, which
                   requires additional computations to perform
                   back-propagation. To waive this requirement, we propose a
                   novel model called DiffMD by directly estimating the
                   gradient of the log density of molecular conformations.
                   DiffMD relies on a score-based denoising diffusion
                   generative model that perturbs the molecular structure with
                   a conditional noise depending on atomic accelerations and
                   treats conformations at previous timeframes as the prior
                   distribution for sampling. Another challenge of modeling
                   such a conformation generation process is that a molecule is
                   kinetic instead of static, which no prior works have

                   the diffusion process to calculate corresponding gradients.
                   It incorporates the directions and velocities of atomic
                   motions via 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel representations.

                   produced state of the art generative models by employing

                   Gaussian noise assumption has several high-dimensional
                   limitations, motivating a more concrete route toward even
                   higher dimension PDF estimation in future. We outline this
                   limitation, before extending the theory to a broader family
                   of noising distributions -- namely, the generalised normal
                   distribution. To theoretically ground this, we relax a key
                   assumption in (denoising) score matching theory,
                   demonstrating that distributions which are differentiable
                   almost everywhere permit the same objective simplification

              interactions are a challenging and time-consuming task because
              peptides are generally more flexible than proteins and tend to
              adopt numerous conformations. There are several benchmarking
              studies on protein-protein, protein-ligand and nucleic
              acid-ligand docking interactions. However, a series of docking
              methods is not rigorously validated for protein-peptide complexes
              in the literature. Considering the importance and wide
              application of peptide docking, we describe benchmarking of 6
              docking methods on 133 protein-peptide complexes having peptide
              length between 9 to 15 residues. The performance of docking
              methods was evaluated using CAPRI parameters like FNAT, I-RMSD,
              L-RMSD. RESULT: Firstly, we performed blind docking and evaluate
              the performance of the top docking pose of each method. It was
              observed that FRODOCK performed better than other methods with
              average L-RMSD of 12.46 {\AA}. The performance of all methods
              improved significantly for their best docking pose and achieved
              highest average L-RMSD of 3.72 {\AA} in case of FRODOCK.
              Similarly, we performed re-docking and evaluated the performance
              of the top and best docking pose of each method. We achieved the
              best performance in case of ZDOCK with average L-RMSD 8.60 {\AA}
              and 2.88 {\AA} for the top and best docking pose respectively.
              Methods were also evaluated on 40 protein-peptide complexes used
              in the previous benchmarking study, where peptide have length up
              to 5 residues. In case of best docking pose, we achieved the
              highest average L-RMSD of 4.45 {\AA} and 2.09 {\AA} for the blind
              docking using FRODOCK and re-docking using AutoDock Vina
              respectively. CONCLUSION: The study shows that FRODOCK performed
              best in case of blind docking and ZDOCK in case of re-docking.
              There is a need to improve the ranking of docking pose generated
              by different methods, as the present ranking scheme is not
              satisfactory. To facilitate the scientific community for

               treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate

               challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the
               network, especially in the presence of missing information.
               DeepWalk's representations can provide F1 scores up to 10\%

              probe experimentally, computer simulations are widely used to
              describe protein dynamics, but at significant computational costs
              that continue to limit the systems that can be studied. Here, we
              demonstrate that machine learning can be trained with simulation
              data to directly generate physically realistic conformational
              ensembles of proteins without the need for any sampling and at
              negligible computational cost. As a proof-of-principle we train a
              generative adversarial network based on a transformer
              architecture with self-attention on coarse-grained simulations of
              intrinsically disordered peptides. The resulting model, idpGAN,
              can predict sequence-dependent coarse-grained ensembles for

              that transferability can be achieved beyond the limited training

               Protein structure prediction is a prominent example of a task
